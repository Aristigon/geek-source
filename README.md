## How to Use Locally via Git/GitHub
We've provided specifics on how to get going in [Project Setup](./requirements/01-project-setup) but here's a quick summary. You'll start by *forking* this project to your own account. UI mockups and requirements for each design can be found in the `requirements` directory. We'll be getting our data from the BestBuy.com developers API, which is covered [here](./requirements/01-project-setup/03-best-buy-api-creds). The `requirements` directory is broken up into chapters to guide you through the process. Be sure to check out the prologue; it'll prime your journey and provide you with some great insights from a veteran developer.

### Third-Party Tools
- Angular or React
- FontAwesome
- Google Web Fonts
- Styled Components (if using React)
- Jest
- BestBuy.com API
