## How to Use
UI mockups and requirements for each design can be found in the `requirements` directory. We'll be getting our data from the BestBuy.com developers API, which is covered in [requirements/01-project-setup/03-best-buy-api-creds](./requirements/01-project-setup/03-best-buy-api-creds). The `requirements` directory is broken up into "chapters" to guide you through the process. Be sure to check out the prologue; it'll prime your journey and provide you with some great insights from a veteran developer.
